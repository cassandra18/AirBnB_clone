# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

#### The goal of the project is to deploy on my server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

The storage system used for this project is a file. But as we advance mySQL will be used as the database storage system.

### The command interpreter

We were tasked to create our own console. It will be used to manage the AirBnB objects.

### How to start the console

To start the console, use the following command: 
```
./console.py
```
The  prompt ***(hbnb)*** will be displayed on your terminal and you can then enter your command

### How to use the console

To use the console, enter the commands and the appropriate arguments. To get the various command that are available, type in your terminal , ***help***. To get the documentation on how to use a command type, ***help followed by the command***.

### Examples of some of the commands and how to use them
